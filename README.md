This repository will not be updated until someone makes change to the KickNoCC code. Let me know if the plugin doesn't work on latest version of MCGalaxy.

This is a protocol blocker plugin. Useful for players that want to create a c0.0.16a_02-c0.0.23a_01 MCGalaxy server, but don't want any newer or older clients to connect.

**READ FIRST**: Since it is possible for ClassiCube players to spoof as older client version via "Nostalgia options", you'll need to disable hacks on MOTD. I can't do anything if the player is using a modified client.

Updated as of September 19, 2025. Compatible with MCGalaxy 1.9.4.3 and above.
